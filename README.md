# Shipster bot

Shipster is a stupid bot that helps you maintain your shopping lists.

This is deliberately over-engineered project:
I wanted to play with the Go language, it's standard library and with some popular libraries.
But I also wanted to produce something useful,
something I'll, probably, use.
